### Openers
1. Make sure everyone is here for JOUR472/772, Introduction to Data Journalism.

2. Introduce myself.
* Data editor for the Howard Center for Investigative reporting.
* Before that I was data editor for Capital News Service and director of the college park bureau for about 10 years.
* I graduated from here 20 years ago!
* I've been a journalist for two decades, working as a Washington correspondent, a statehouse reporter in Florida.  For my whole career -- after taking this class here in 1999 -- I've made using data an important part of the work I do.  
* My teaching style is very hands-on, prioritizing learning-by-doing.  There won't be a lot of lectures in this course. There will be a lot of hands on work, because this work benefits from repetition.
* This is my promise to you: if you are struggling with the work we do in here, and you ask me for help, I will make time to help you.    

3. Student Introductions.
* Have then fill out forms.
* Why are you interested in learning more about data journalism? (fine if you say this is required)
* How do you think this course will help you in your career -- and what do you want to do when you graduate?   

### Lecture/Discussion Content

* What is data journalism exercise?

* My definition of data journalism.
  * I come down more on the "science"-based approach, data science.
  * Shared by people like Phil Meyer, the godfather of this work, Julia Angwin at the Markup, Ben Welsh.  

* Transparency.  We are open about how we did our work and we freely share it and document it.  People don't trust journalists, and you can't just drop a story based on data analysis without backing it up. I'll show you my method for documenting as we do analysis.
* Analysis.  Sometimes this means computing fancy statistics, and using advanced machine learning.  But sometimes it literally means finding one tiny bit of information scanning through a spreadsheet, and using that as a foundation for further reporting.
* Digital Information. There is so much data in the world.  Stored in many formats.  Some of its structured, in spreadsheets. Some of its big huge bodies of dumped documents.  
* Reporting: It's not a separate thing from the reporting process.  It's part of the process. If you want to learn this because you never want to interview a human again, I have bad news for you.  Context.  Methods. Checks.  We'll talk again and again about that in this class.
* Meticulous. We always assume we are getting something wrong, and set out to prove ourself wrong. This means getting obsessive about how we look at data.  
* Community.  The growing group of people who do this work help each other, share data, share information.  NICAR and IRE. We'll get connected to some of these groups as part of this class.
* Facts, Patterns, and Proof and Examples: data journalism is great for both establishing a pattern that forms bones of a story -- a pattern showing opioid deaths increased in counties the most where drug companies sent the most pills -- and identifying anecdotes -- the pharmacy in the county in West Virginia with the highest death rate that received the most pills.  
* Stories: Our goal is to tell stories, not to present a bunch of data and say "look at this data".  That can happen in lots of forms, including text, graphics, video, podcasts, social platforms. We'll talk a lot about this.

### Syllabus Review

Hand out the syllabus and point out the highlights.

**Contacting Me**
I am here to help you.  I will do my best to respond within 24 hours.  You can text, just say your name.  You can email.  

It is especially important that anyone who falls into one of the following two categories come see me very early in the semester:
•	If you are finding this too difficult
•	If you are finding it too easy and the classes are a drag for you – we will have to brainstorm a solution, or I might ask you to serve during class sessions as a desk-mate / coach / helper to someone else in class who is struggling.

**Learning Outcomes**

The idea here is to teach you the pipeline from initial reporting, data discovery, acquisition, cleaning and verification, analysis, follow-up reporting, fact-checking.  To understand how to use data to tell stories. And as a foundation for future work.

Go over specific outcomes.

**Required Texts and Materials**

**Grading and attendance**

**Review Assignments** through **Students in Need**

-- Go over that.

### How Class Will Work

* Blended, half online, half in person
* Every week we'll have an Asynchronous online lab, meaning completed it whenever you want before Sunday. It will be released after class each Tuesday.
  * Designed to teach you skills and concepts critical to this class.
  * You'll typically have a file to upload after that.
* Every week we'll have a class on Tuesdays.  
  * some kind of discussion/lecture
  * an in-class data exercise designed to reinforce what you've learned in prior week's lab.
  * Homework will consist of readings, forum posts and occasional other stuff.
* Option lab time for you to get help from me on Fridays at same time.  If you can't make it, come see me another time.  If that doesn't work for lots of you, we can talk!
* Materials you'll need will be on this github repo, but you'll typically turn stuff in on ELMS.
