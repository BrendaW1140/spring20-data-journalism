# Story discussion project

This project will help you and your classmates understand how journalists use data to find and tell compelling, meaningful stories. It is worth 5 percent of your grade.

## How this works  

Each week, the entire class will read the same inspiring work of journalism that could not have been produced without original data analysis. And each week, everyone in the class will write a short forum post, which will prove you have some familiarity with the material. Deep reading is of course preferred, but not required.

Each week, a rotating team of two students will be assigned to do a deep dive on a story, share their findings with the class, and lead a short discussion.   

## Deliverables

* A 1.5 to 2 page, single-spaced memo (turned in online, and bring 20 copies to bring to class on the day of your presentation) that briefly describes the following points, with the following subheads for each section:
  * Summary | summarize the story and its major conclusions.  
  * The Data | describe the data used in the analysis, including details on how it was obtained. What did they go through to get it and prepare it for analysis?    
  * The Analysis | describe the nature of the analysis. What techniques did they use? Did they transparently describe their analysis in detail in a link from the project? Was their approach especially novel, or statistically complex? Does it seem like something you'll be able to do at the end of this class? Can you find the "data notebook" or code repository where they described their analysis, perhaps on GitHub.      
  * The Reporting | describe the reporting that went into fleshing out the stories.  What did they do to bring this story to life? Who did they talk to?  
  * The Storytelling | describe the quality of the writing and presentation.  Did the story feel "data heavy" or filled with numbers? Were the analysis findings described in a straightforward way? Did they use effective visuals to communicate complex topics?
  * Without the Data | imagine this story without the data analysis component. Is it still a story?  Is the story as strong?

* A Google Slides deck with six slides, one for each subhead in the memo.  You will be given a template to follow.

* A six-minute "lightning talk" presentation that uses the slide deck you've turned in, hitting the main points described in your memo.  Each person in a group should present for part of the time.      

* Five brief discussion questions (turned in online and 20 copies printed out to bring to class on the day of your presentation) or prompts to get your classmates to share their thoughts on the story and on your conclusions about the story.  These are up to you, but I'm happy to offer feedback in advance if you'd like to talk them out with me.

## Grading

Grades will be assigned as follows.

* Memo - 50 percent
* Slide deck - 5 percent
* Presentation - 15 percent
* Discussion lead - 15 percent  
* Active discussion participant in weeks you aren't presenting - 15 percent
* Extra Credit - 5 percent.  Talk with the reporter/data journalists and find out how they got the idea to do the story, and how reporting contributed to the analysis.

This project will give you a chance to go through the process of analyzing a complex database on your own in order to discover newsworthy information.

## The data

You will work with the DEA's ARCOS database, using the slice released by the Washington Post that contains detailed information on hydrocodone and oxycodone shipments between 2006 and 2012.  

To obtain the data, you will work with the ARCOS R package produced by the Washington Post.  You will also be required to bring additional data to bear on this question.

## Your motivation

You should approach this assignment through one of three lenses.  The data has just been released by the Washington Post, and you should approach this project as:

* A reporter for a local news organization, primarily interested in using the data to find trends and examples that affect one specific area (a county or group of counties), and then putting what you find in state and national context.   
* A reporter for a national news organization, interested in using the data to describe broad nationwide trend, and then finding specific locations and examples that are emblematic of that trend.

In both cases, you are interested in using your analysis as the foundation for a specific, newsworthy story angle (or angles) that has not been reported by another news organization.  Your story should shed some light on how free-flowing sales of prescription opioids helped drive the opioid crisis in the United States.
