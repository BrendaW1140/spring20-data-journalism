# In Class Assignment 1

## Purpose

Today's in-class assignment is designed to reinforce the techniques you learned in the first lab, and give you more experience in doing journalistic data analysis working with opioid data.

## Setup

1.  Download top pharmacy, distributor and manufacturer data for Logan County, West Virginia from the [Washington Post "Digging into the DEA's pain pill database" page](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/).  If you're having trouble, the data is available [in this folder](data/).  Note: the data in the data folder reflects data before they updated it recently.

2.  Create a new Google Sheets workbook and name it "In_Class_Assignment_01 YOUR NAME Sheet".  Set the permissions to "anyone with link can edit".  

3.  Upload the three tab-delimited text files into a new sheet inside of the workbook you created.  Rename each sheet with "Original-no-edit" in front of the name.  Make a copy of each sheet, renamed "Pharmacy-working", "Distributor-working" and "Manufacturer-working".  Create a new spreadsheet called "Source" that describes the source, date and details of the data.

4.  Set up each working sheet as you learned in the first video. Do a four-corners check looking for missing values.  Add a "record number" column to give each row a unique record number.  Freeze the first row. Format the numbers nicely.

5.  Create a Google Doc called "In_Class_Assignment_01 YOUR NAME memo". Set the permissions to "anyone with the link can edit". Paste the questions below into this memo document. Also paste a link to your spreadsheet.

## Questions

Answer as many of the following questions as you can.  It's okay if you don't finish them all.  Just get as far as you can.  There are more questions here than most people will be able to finish by the end of class. 

You will need to create some new columns in the spreadsheet to do this and some new rows.  You will probably need to sort.  Be sure to keep your spreadsheet nice and tidy as you go. If you're confused what this means, look back at the example spreadsheet in our first lab video.      

1.  How many total pills of hydrocodone and oxycodone were sent to Logan County, West Virginia between 2006 and 2012 (if you use the data in GitHub.  If you use the newer data downloaded from Post site, it's between 2006 and 2014)?  Do the three spreadsheets offer conflicting numbers?

2.  What was the average number of pills per shipment sent to the pharmacy that got the most total pills between 2006 and 2012 (if you use the data in GitHub.  If you use the newer data downloaded from Post site, it's between 2006 and 2014)?  How did that compare to the average number of pills per shipment to other pharmacies in the county? What was the name of the pharmacy?

3.  How many total pills were shipped to Rite-Aid pharmacies?

4.  What was the name of the doctor or doctors ranked 26th for number of opioids received?  How many pills did that person or persons get? How many shipments? (Use a rank function to calculate this)

5.  Does the number of pills distributed by Rite-Aid (in the distributor working sheet) match the number of pills received by Rite-Aid pharmacies (in the pharmacy working sheet)? What could be an explanation for this?

6.  Which two companies alone accounted for more than half of all pill distribution in the county?  How much did they account for?

7.  Is the 10th ranked company for total pills distributed to the county still in business? Write a brief (no more than three sentences) summary of what happened to the company.

8.  One company was responsible for manufacturing nearly two-thirds of all pills sent to Logan County.  What was the name of that company?  What was the exact percentage for which they accounted?  

9.  According to a July 27 Washington Post story on the role of the company that is the answer to question 9, the chief executive of that company said under oath (in a deposition) that his company had "no responsibility or accountability" for how the pills were used after they were distributed.  According to court records detailed in the story, what was his response to the DEA when it asked him to cut production of opioids?

10. Purdue Pharma is often named as the company that kick-started the opioid crisis.  Where did it rank in terms of number of pills shipped to Logan County by all pharmacies?  What percentage did it account for?

11. Imagine you're a reporter for a local paper in Logan County, West Virginia and you've been assigned a story the data this data is released.  Write the first three paragraphs, based on what you think is most important here.
